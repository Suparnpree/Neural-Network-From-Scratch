I created my own neural Network from scratch without using any framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow. I just used Numpy and Mathematics Equations to build this neural network. I created this neural network to predict daily  
revenue of a coffee shop. I used 3 features in my input layer. 32 neurons in the hidden layer and 1 neuron in the output layer. This is an example of linear regression. I used the Mean square error function.
